### Easy Installation

**Sorry, the easy installation is pending an issue submitted to Hyper, we'll get that back as soon as possible. For now, use the manual install.**

Simply install the `rainglow` package within your Hyper package list and restart.

Now add `rainglow: 'theme-name-here',` to the `config` section of your Hyper config, swapping out the theme name for the one that you want. For example:

```
rainglow: 'peacock',
rainglow: 'warlock-contrast',
rainglow: 'bold-light',
```

You might need to restart the editor after changing the theme, but probably not! Enjoy!

### Manual Installation

Clone the `rainglow/hyper` repository into `~/.hyper_plugins/local` and rename to 'rainglow'.

Next add rainglow to your local plugins (`localPlugins: ['rainglow'],`) in settings and restart.

Now add `rainglow: 'theme-name-here',` to the `config` section of your Hyper config, swapping out the theme name for the one that you want. For example:

```
rainglow: 'peacock',
rainglow: 'warlock-contrast',
rainglow: 'bold-light',
```

You might need to restart the editor after changing the theme, but probably not! Enjoy!


### Useful Information

This project is an evolution of my colour schemes project found at [https://github.com/daylerees/colour-schemes](https://github.com/daylerees/colour-schemes). Peacock was the first ever theme. I created it to try and find something to use other than Monokai. It's now a favourite for many users!

If you'd like to report a bug with one of the color schemes, please raise an issue on the repository rather than submitting a pull request. This is because the themes run through a generation process, and editing the themes directly is not advised!

Have a wonderful day!

Dayle.
